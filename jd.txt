About the Role
We are seeking a senior-level Generative AI Developer and Subject Matter Expert to lead the design, development, and deployment of advanced AI and machine learning solutions. This role requires deep expertise in generative AI model development, natural language processing (NLP), and neural network architectures, with a proven track record of delivering enterprise-grade AI applications. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to integrate AI-driven capabilities into large-scale platforms, driving innovation and business transformation.

Key Responsibilities

    Design, build, and train generative AI models using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer architectures
    Develop AI/ML algorithms for natural language generation (NLG), image synthesis, content creation, and conversational AI applications
    Collaborate with engineering, data science, and product teams to integrate AI models into production-grade enterprise applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content platforms
    Optimize models for performance, scalability, and accuracy using advanced techniques such as reinforcement learning and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)
    Conduct rigorous experimentation, data analysis, and model evaluation to ensure robust AI solutions
    Stay current with cutting-edge research in AI, machine learning, and deep learning, applying the latest techniques to business challenges

Required Qualifications

    Extensive hands-on experience developing and deploying generative AI models into production environments
    Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras
    Strong background in neural network architectures, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision
    Experience with end-to-end AI project lifecycle, from data preprocessing to deployment and monitoring
    Knowledge of cloud-based AI platforms such as AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning, or Google Vertex AI
    Strong problem-solving and analytical skills with experience working in fast-paced, agile environments

Preferred Qualifications

    Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field
    Experience with large-scale distributed systems and big data processing (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)
    Background in telecommunications or large enterprise AI solutions
    Familiarity with MLOps practices and AI model governance
